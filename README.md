# Infant Mortality Risk Factors in Northern Nigeria: A Demographic Health Survey Analysis

## 🔬 Project Overview

This epidemiological study investigates the sociodemographic determinants of infant mortality in Northern Nigeria using data from the 2018 Nigerian Demographic Health Survey (NDHS). The research employs advanced statistical modeling to identify key risk factors that contribute to infant deaths before the first birthday, providing critical insights for public health interventions and policy development.

## 📊 Research Impact & Significance

### Public Health Value

- **Healthcare Policy Support**: Generated evidence-based recommendations for maternal and child health interventions
- **Health Disparities Research**: Quantified the impact of socioeconomic inequalities on infant survival outcomes
- **Global Health Contribution**: Addressed critical knowledge gaps in Sub-Saharan African infant mortality patterns

### Statistical & Methodological Rigor
- **Large-Scale Analysis**: Processed nationally representative survey data with 99% response rate
- **Multivariable Modeling**: Applied advanced logistic regression with proper confounding control
- **Model Validation**: Comprehensive diagnostic testing including multicollinearity and influence analysis
- **Regulatory Standards**: Followed epidemiological best practices for observational research

## 🎯 Key Research Findings

### Primary Risk Factors Identified (Adjusted Odds Ratios):

**Socioeconomic Determinants:**
- **Wealth Index**: Richest families had 67% lower infant mortality risk (OR=0.33, 95%CI: 0.28-0.37)
- **Maternal Education**: Higher education reduced risk by 18% (OR=0.82, 95%CI: 0.69-0.96)
- **Birth Spacing**: >2 year intervals reduced risk by 73% (OR=0.27, 95%CI: 0.24-0.31)

**Demographic Patterns:**
- **Child Sex**: Female infants had 14% lower mortality risk (OR=0.86, 95%CI: 0.82-0.90)
- **Maternal Age**: Optimal outcomes for mothers aged 25-39 years
- **Maternal BMI**: Overweight mothers showed 25% lower risk vs. underweight (OR=0.75, 95%CI: 0.64-0.88)

### Clinical Significance
- **9% infant mortality rate** in the study population (7,270 out of 80,110 cases)
- Strong dose-response relationships across wealth and education gradients
- Clear evidence of modifiable risk factors for targeted interventions
